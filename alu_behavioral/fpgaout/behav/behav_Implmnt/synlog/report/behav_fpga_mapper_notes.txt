@N: MT320 |This timing report is an estimate of place and route data. For final timing results, use the FPGA vendor place and route report.
@N: MT322 |Clock constraints include only register-to-register paths associated with each individual clock.
@N: MT582 |Estimated period and frequency not reported for given clock unless the clock has at least one timing path which is not a false or a max delay path and that does not have excessive slack
